<h1 id="history-of-ar">History of AR</h1>

<p>Different sources trace the history of augmented reality back to the beginning of the 20th century, but it can be said that seminal work was done in the 1960s by Ivan Sutherlands and others.
The term augmented reality however was coined by Thomas P. Caudellin the 80s according to [^1] (Lee, Kangdon (March 2012). “Augmented Reality in Education and Training” (PDF). Techtrends: Linking Research &amp; Practice to Improve Learning. 56 (2).)</p>

<h1 id="ancient-precursors">Ancient precursors</h1>

<p><strong>In 1584</strong>, Giambattista della Porta publishes a book entitled ‘Magia Naturalis’, in which he presents 
the concept of a room in which you have a glass pane set up in a way that it reflects light bouncing off of 
objects in a different position, creating the illusion as if these objects were somewhere else 
than they actually are. This is pretty much earliest description of Augmented Reality we 
have discovered so far, and the principle of reflection off a semi-transparent mirror is
still popular today for head-mounted displays, albeit slightly miniaturised.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1584.jpg" alt="Natural Magic (1584)" /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let there be a chamber wherein no other light comes, unless by the door or window where the spectator looks in. Let the whole window or part of it be of glass, as we use to do to keep out the cold. But let one part be polished, that there may be a Looking-glass on bothe sides, whence the spectator must look in. For the rest do nothing. Let pictures be set over against this window, marble statues and suchlike. For what is without will seem to be within, and what is behind the spectator’s back, he will think to be in the middle of the house, as far from the glass inward, as they stand from it outwardly, and clearly and certainly, that he will think he sees nothing but truth. But lest the skill should be known, let the part be made so where the ornament is, that the spectator may not see it, as above his head, that a pavement may come between above his head. And if an ingenious man do this, it is impossible that he should suppose that he is deceived.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>In 1862</strong>, John Henry Pepper (1821-1900) and Henry Dircks (1806-1873) create an illusion (projection) technique, called Pepper’s ghost,  used in the theater.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1862.jpg" alt="Pepper's Ghost (1962)" /></p>

<p>The basic trick here is that there are two rooms built on the stage, one that people can see into, the other one (called blue room) that is hidden. For the illusion, you set up a big glass in the main room at 45 degree angle that is able to reflect the view of the blue room towards the audience in order to project ‘floating’ ghost objects onto the spatiality of the twin room.</p>

<p>Dircks had come up with the idea, but failed to market it. Pepper teamed up with him, modified the lay-out (reducing installation costs), and made it popular.</p>

<p>The technique is still in use for modern projection AR, in particular in theatres (using silver-threaded gauze and short-throw projectors instead of glass and lighting objects in order to avoid the need for a twin ‘blue’ room).</p>

<p><strong>In 1958</strong>, early head-up displays (HUDs) are used for the military, in fighter planes, superimposing 
graphics onto the real world by projecting onto a glass plane in the field of view of the pilot. This 
requires the pilot no longer to look ‘heads-down’ at the instruments, hence the name ‘heads-up’. 
This way, AR can display on any transparent display.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1958.jpg" alt="Head-Up Display (HUD, 1958)" /></p>

<p><strong>In 1945</strong>, head-mounted display history was written, when Henry McCollum patented the first Stereoscopic Television Apparatus.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1945.png" alt="McCollum's Stereoscopic TV (1945)" /></p>

<p><strong>In 1960</strong>, Morten Heiling also patented a stereoscopic television HMD for individual use. By many, this device is seen as the mother of all smart glasses, highlighting its importance (together with Heilig’s Sensorama for VR) as a milestone in the history of computing.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1960.png" alt="Heilig's Telesphere Mask (1960)" /></p>

<p><strong>In 1961,</strong> Philco’s Headsight-Remote Camera Viewing system came out. The helmet included a video screen and tracking system.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1961.jpg" alt="Headsight TV Surveillance System by the Philco Corporation (1961)" /></p>

<p><strong>In 1968,</strong> Sutherland and Sproull developed the ‘Sword of Damocles’ that is the first augmented reality head-mounted display (HMD) and tracking system.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1968.jpg" alt="Sword of Damocles (1968)" /></p>

<p><strong>In the 1960ies and 1970ies</strong>, the US Airforce develops several versions of helmet-mounted displays (HMD) in aircraft to project data in front of pilots’ eyes.</p>

<p><img src="../../assets/figures/history/1960ies.jpg" alt="US airforce helmet displays (1960ies-70ies" /></p>

<p><strong>1980ies</strong>, the concept of AR is picked up by the film industry, embedding the idea into the story line of works such as ‘The Terminator’ (1984), ‘Robocop’ (1987), and ‘They live’ (1988).</p>

<p><strong>In 1992,</strong>  the term “Augmented Reality” was coined at Boeing in a publication by Thomas P. Caudell and David W. Mizell.</p>
