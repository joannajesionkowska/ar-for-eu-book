# Applications, Employments and Careers in AR

Augmented Reality (AR) has a unique quality to provide a direct link between physical reality and virtual information about that reality [1]. It provides a real-time direct or indirect view of a physical world, which is enhanced by adding virtual information to it [2], overlying virtual information on to it. AR combines real and virtual; it is interactive in real time and registered in 3D [2]. AR technology can improve the way organisations operate, making processes faster and more effective. Besides that AR has an advantage of ability to create incredible new experiences. AR is a technology capable of shaping competitive advantage for many companies and therefore vital from the strategic management point of view (Grzegorczyk et al., 2019). Consequently companies using this technology may outperform their rivals in terms of value creation.

1. Applications of AR technology 

AR applications supplement the real world by incorporating virtual or computer-generated content [3]. They are software applications which merge the digital visual content into the user’s real-world environment. An AR application needs to well match the affordances offered by AR as well as be well executed and meet the needs of the user of the application. An application needs to use AR in a way that is advantageous or in application areas where there is no other way to experience the application. Essential characteristics of a good AR application are listed below:
it  exploits  the  affordances provided by AR such as that it is situated in the real world at a particular place and time and that it adds digital information to the real world that is registered with the real world;
It solves a problem or otherwise makes life better in some way that takes advantage of augmented reality to do it in a different way  than  other  media  or  does  something  that  can’t  be  done  in  other  media;
It allows the participants to experience some sensory phenomena that they couldn’t otherwise.
The process of applying AR to a problem (what needs to be done) is presented below:
(Fig. 1)
The first step is to determine whether AR might be a good medium to use, if the affordances of AR are appropriate. It might be worth doing a rapid prototype to see if AR provides the expected solution. It is also important to do research if there are already existing applications, whether directly connected with the problem or not. That gives a direction what types of hardware, software, interaction mechanisms will be most suitable for a new application. Next steps are designing, implementing and evaluating the application. This process is different from designing any other technological solution because it requires considering all the aspects of the real world that will be part of the application and how they interact with the virtual aspects of the content.

In general, we can distinguish two use categories: professional and consumer. 
For professional users, new technologies are potential tools for achieving a certain objective either faster (and, hence, cheaper) or with higher quality. In professional domains, it is acceptable to buy and use hardware, even if it is expensive, if the gains from using the new tool are believed to be sufficiently substantial. AR applications for the professional domain must be robust and well-tested. They may be expensive, require special hardware, but they must provide substantial gains that cannot be achieved with traditional alternatives. For casual consumers, the threshold for accepting a new technology is lower, as no lasting benefit is required for adoption. This makes AR attractive in the short term for purposes such as advertising and games, where an interesting and amusing experience is in itself the desired achievement. A consumer application must be very easy to use, require almost no training, software-only solution delivered to devices the users already own. 

Considering AR’s specificity, a big advantage of this technology is a variety of possible applications, ranging from training and education, medicine and healthcare, travel and tourism,to retail and marketing purposes (Martínez et al.2014). 


2. AR market

VR and AR have the potential to deliver a $1.5 trillion boost to the global economy by 2030. Besides that it is AR that will continue to provide a bigger boost to GDP through to 2030, compared to VR.
(fig. 2)
Augmented Reality Market is set to exceed $338.1bn by 2025 and $1,092 by 2030 according to a new research report by PwC [ref]. The shipments are forecast to grow at over 75% CAGR from 2017 to 2024.[x] The AR market is expected to witness substantial growth owing to advances in hardware technologies and sophisticated mobile software. 
The figure below illustrates the growth for both, hardware and software.
(Fig. 4)
The hardware segment is estimated to grow at a CAGR of over 90% from 2016 to 2024. Commercialization of devices is bolstering the market growth, furthermore several companies are working on enhancing the quality of sensors and processors used in AR devices. Increasing penetration of smartphones and tablets are expected to drive the software segment, growing at a CAGR of over 55% from 2016 to 2024. Increasing demand for AR apps in retail, gaming, and entertainment is expected to contribute to industry growth. The head-mounted display (HMD) segment is anticipated to dominate the market growing at a CAGR of nearly 70%from 2016 to 2024. The reason is the increasing scope of applications across the military, medicine, scientific visualization, manufacturing, education, training, navigation, and entertainment. The other factors driving demand include better content connectivity, enhanced user-experience and improved Field of View (FOV). The adoption of smart glasses is expected to increase significantly in the consumer segment. Several companies are developing advanced smart glasses which are more user-friendly, lightweight and offer better FOV. [x]

The graph below illustrates the size of the market in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific and rest of the world.
(fig. 5)
Currently the biggest companies in the augmented reality market are in North America, but the predictions are that Asian market are following, and may even outpace the American market. Google (US) holds the leading position. Major players in the augmented reality market are Google, Inc. (US), PTC, Inc. (US), Microsoft Corporation (US), Seiko Epson (Japan), Lenovo (China), Wikitude Gmbh (Austria), Vuzix (US), Daqri Llc (US), Magic Leap, Inc. (US), Zugara, Inc. (US), Blippar (UK), Upskill (US), and Maxst (South Korea). Other players operating in market include Atheer, Inc.(US), Pristine, Inc.(US), Marxent Labs, Llc.(US), Inglobe Technologies (Italy), Meta Company(US), Augment (France), Niantic (US), Sixense Entertainment(US), Intel Corporation(US), Apple Inc.(US), Infinity Augmented Reality, Inc. (Israel), Facebook Corporation (US), Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. (South Korea), Realwear (US), Dynabook Americas, Inc.(US), and Optinvent (France).[] The companies engage in frequent merger and acquisitions to increase their product portfolio and geographical presence to gain competitive advantage.

A market growing at such pace requires tens of thousands of specialists, a substantial increase from the current number of skilled AR professionals available today. According to the report by Hired there’s been a 1,400 percent growth in interview demand for AR/VR engineers in the past year (2019). In Europe it is forecast that over 400 thousand jobs will be enhanced by virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) technologies in both Germany and the UK by 2030, an increase from the 10 to 15 thousand jobs that were enhanced by VR and AR in each of these countries in 2019. The number of AR/VR projects is only expected to increase in the years to come, as software engineers think we’ll see the full impact of AR/VR within the next 5 years.
(fig.6)
Positions in AR/VR require the ability to work with a large amount of data, generated on the web and stored in cloud databases as well as specific programming languages. Since there aren’t enough engineers who are already proficient in coding for AR/VR to meet the hiring demand, engineers are increasingly looking to self-teaching methods to broaden their skill set, in addition to seeking out computer science training in school. According to Hired half of the software engineers they surveyed have a computer science degree, 22% are self-taught and another 10% learned to code through a bootcamp program.

The lack of technical expertise is expected to challenge the industry growth. The long term solution is rising inclusion of the technology in academic syllabi.

3. AR skills

Developers, software designers, 3D artists, software architects and engineers, system validation engineers, project managers, marketing specialists, sales and distribution – each AR developer team has different specialist roles to fill. Creating augmented reality applications requires particular skills. In the scope of the AR-for-EU project an analysis of job offers was done and it resulted in extracting a list of categories of skills required for AR specialists. The list of essential skills was validated by experts involved in recrutation process in AR companies. They were asked if they think that there will be increased demand for these skills in their organisation over the next 3-5 year. The results are summarised in the following table:
(Tab. 1)

The figure below presents the ‘top 10 skills’. Those skills were chosen by experts as the most important for the future AR specialists. The percentage describes how many experts see them as crucial.
(fig.7)
The core skills as AR software development kits, mastering Unity, object recognition, proficiency in using smart glasses are the key skills for AR developers. Moreover indispensable are user interface and user centered design to provide a smooth user experiences and interactions with a product or service. Furthemore artificial intelligence and machine learning are the key to enabling AR to interact with the physical environment in a multidimensional way. Finally computer vision and 3D modelling  are necessary to ensure realistic 3D model look.
